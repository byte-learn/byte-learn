### Notes 

- Make sure D1, D2, D3 datasets are unzipped before running the notebooks
- The code and requiremenets for DPCNN implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/jeremypoulain/nlplay).
	- Some files are modified to adapt with the requirements of our datasets. Simply after cloning `nlplay` repository, checkout the repo at `bfc0b7bad34a46f7b9ef3e86d65c012e7d1bae39` and apply `nlplay.patch` patch. 
	- Make sure the parameters and paths are set correctly in `dpcnn_train_script.py`.
